# .DS_Store-parser
Parses the .DS_Store files generated by macOS.

.DS_Store files contain records of the different properties (fields) of the
files or directories of the directory of .DS_Store.  These fields can specify
things like modification dates, icons, backgrounds, comments, etc.  Each field
has a four-char name and variable length and type data.  Each file has a number
of unique fields.  See the second link below for the meaning of each field.

## Usage
```sh
python3 parse.py <.DS_Store file>
```

## More about .DS_Stores
Since .DS_Store formats are proprietary, there aren't official specifications
and current parsers and formats are more or less speculations.

It's worth saying that a large portion of the .DS_Store appears to be junk.
Maybe the OS writes to the places that are convenient and doesn't care about
.DS_Store sizes.

Below are some helpful links for .DS_Store.  I used some of them.
